# @hypit/provider-hyperframes-local

Trusted local Provider for the `@hypit/render-hyperframes#render-visual` capability. It stages the
Resource dependencies declared by a `HyperframesDocument`, renders a silent MP4 with the
HyperFrames engine, probes the bytes, and returns a verified `RenderedVisual`. Before staging a typed
Surface it decodes the exact bytes and checks declared dimensions, still/frame timing, SDR/sRGB and
opaque/straight-alpha facts. These checks validate the typed rendering input; they do not create
content identity or hidden output metadata.

Normalized transparent videos displayed by Media or project components use the ordinary video path.
The engine decodes them to PNG frames with alpha, then Chrome blends them with lower layers and
the authored Canvas background. Final frames use fast PNG encoding after Chrome has composited
the image onto an opaque canvas (black beneath the authored background). This trades intermediate
compression effort for speed without JPEG frame compression. Source alpha, CSS filters, canvas and
WebGL remain part of the browser composition. The returned MP4 contains the completed composition.

Runtime configuration separates work size from shared capacity:

- `defaultConcurrency` limits whole render requests admitted by the Endpoint's Runtime capacity resource.
- Optional `browserCapacity` limits Chrome slots shared by all render Needs in the same `pool`.
  Each Need reserves its fixed count or automatic ceiling atomically with the whole-request slot.
  An explicit count larger than this budget reports a configuration error. Auto fits its ceiling
  to the shared budget before admission.
  Both reservations last for the whole Need, including preparation and final encoding. Closing one
  Chrome early does not release part of that reservation. Without `browserCapacity`, admission uses
  the whole-request limit alone.
- `workers` controls independent Chrome processes inside one admitted render. Explicit counts are
  honored, capped only by selected frame count. `auto` starts below its ceiling, then compares useful
  capture batches before adding another browser. Insufficient benefit or falling throughput retires
  surplus browsers between batches. Completed frames are retained; there is no calibration render.
- Optional `maxWorkers` sets the automatic ceiling. Without it, the Provider leaves two CPU slots
  and half the machine/container memory for other work, budgeting about 1.5 GiB per Chrome process.
  Auto also caps the reservation to the number of roughly one-second batches in the selected range.

The Runtime Profile configures these controls through the Provider because they are deployment policy.
The automatic ceiling is fixed at activation, and range sizing is identical in admission and execution.
Actual concurrency adapts inside that reservation; it is not a machine-wide history or performance database. It never
renders program audio; `@hypit/provider-media-local` separately prepares `TimelineAudio` and muxes
the final media.

For a Runtime Profile, place `pool` on the Endpoint entry and these Provider settings inside
`config`. This is an illustrative entry to merge into the Profile's existing `endpoints`:

```json
"hyperframes.local": {
  "use": "@hypit/provider-hyperframes-local",
  "pool": "local-render",
  "config": {
    "workers": 4,
    "defaultConcurrency": 2,
    "browserCapacity": 6
  }
}
```

This configuration admits one 4-worker request at a time under its 6-browser budget even though
the whole-request limit is 2. Two 4-worker requests would need 8 browser slots. Choose budgets from
the actual machine and shared workloads; the example is not an automatic tuning recommendation.
New Builds use the edited Provider configuration; active Builds retain their selected configuration.
Restart Studio if its existing session needs to load the edited Profile.

`browserGpu` picks Chrome's rasterizer and defaults to `hardware`. Set `software` without a usable
GPU, or `auto` to let the engine decide. Capture uses screenshots and independent browser processes;
the CLI's automatic worker and drawElement policies do not override the count. The opaque screenshot
adapter uses the engine's public session, video injector and page seek protocol plus Chrome CDP.
It waits for seek completion, dynamic images/fonts and the page compositor before capturing PNGs.
The pinned engine couples its PNG session setup to transparent export, so this adapter initializes
an opaque session and chooses PNG separately at capture. It does not patch engine methods or files.

The Runtime Adapter also declares one managed browser program. `programs up` invokes the pinned
HyperFrames CLI's `browser ensure`; its probe resolves and starts that browser and checks
the FFmpeg/FFprobe toolchain before a Build.

The same executor is exported for callers with an already compiled document:

```ts
import { renderHyperframesVisual } from "@hypit/provider-hyperframes-local";

const visual = await renderHyperframesVisual(
  { document, range: { startFrame: 240, endFrameExclusive: 360 } },
  { resources, workers: 4, onProgress: (event) => console.log(event) },
);
```

Omit `range` for the complete document. Ranges are zero-based and half-open on the original
programme clock. At 30 fps, `[240, 360)` returns 120 frames covering seconds 8–12.
`onProgress` reports resource staging, source decoding, the requested range, per-worker frame counts, browser PIDs,
encoding, storage and elapsed time to direct executor callers. The Provider reduces parallel worker
events to a single phase and aggregate count through `context.reportProgress`. CLI status and follow
display that activity without `--verbose`. Counter writes are coalesced to about once per second;
phase changes and completed counts are reported promptly. Local activity belongs to the running
Command, not a remote Operation or a repeatedly rewritten Result manifest.
`processTimeoutMs` defaults to 30 minutes and starts one deadline before resource preparation. It
covers resource reads, Surface validation, rendering and output storage. `signal` can end the same
execution earlier. ResourceStore I/O and Surface probes receive the cancellation signal; a custom
ResourceStore must implement the port's cancellation behavior, including streaming reads and writes.

Browser launch, source extraction, capture and encoding run in one disposable child process per
render. At cancellation it receives a stop request and has up to five seconds to clean up. The owner
then terminates any remaining process tree, including Chrome's separate process groups, and awaits
the child exit before removing temporary files and returning failure. This also covers engine calls
that do not accept a signal. The deadline initiates shutdown; the call may spend additional time
closing resources. Completed Outputs in the Build remain available for a new Run and Build.

Deployments may additionally set `initializationTimeoutMs` or `frameTimeoutMs` when they have a
measured stage deadline. Initialization here means initializing an already created browser session;
Chrome launch precedes it. Stage deadlines are otherwise unset, allowing a busy machine to spend
more of the shared render budget on a slow initialization or frame.
An explicit stage-timeout error names the worker and stage/frame, aborts sibling workers and awaits
cleanup. A completed worker closes its Chrome immediately.

One call stages the HTML and every declared asset once. Typed Surface validation includes a complete
decoded-frame count, even for a short render interval. The renderer then finds source-frame windows
needed by that interval, merges overlapping windows, and extracts them one source/window at a time.
Decoded PNGs are shared by all workers in this call. Each worker initializes its own page, then takes
short contiguous frame batches from the render's in-memory queue. A free worker can continue with
another batch instead of waiting for a worker assigned a more expensive passage. Batches span at
most about one second and preserve the original absolute frame times. Output numbering starts at
zero; final H.264 encoding runs once after all workers finish. This division is internal to one
render call; it does not create or resume Builds. Extra workers help only while aggregate throughput
improves. Staging, validation, source extraction and final encoding still contribute their own cost.

Each call has its own temporary directory, local server port and Chrome processes. Separate renders
do not share staged files or decoded PNGs. Exact compiler sampling markers retain loops, holds and
fractional playback rates. There is no SVML rewrite, intermediate cut MP4 or repeat normalization.
Already compiled video documents need the current compiler's frame markers.

Source extraction uses the pinned engine's FFmpeg/FFprobe resolver. `ffmpegPath` selects the final
H.264 encoder; `ffprobePath` verifies output and typed surfaces. `nodePath` and `hyperframesCliPath`
serve managed browser installation. The requested frame range travels in the Model's Need.

```ts
import { createLocalHyperframesProvider } from "@hypit/provider-hyperframes-local";

const provider = createLocalHyperframesProvider({
  pool: "local-render",
  workers: 4,
  defaultConcurrency: 2,
  browserCapacity: 6,
});
```

Two instances in `local-render`, configured with 4 and 2 workers and identical capacity limits, can
render together. With `browserCapacity: 4`, the second waits. Coordination applies to Builds sharing
the same Runtime Execution Store; the pool name alone does not coordinate separate stores or machines.
Direct `renderHyperframesVisual()` calls do not enter Runtime's shared admission system.

The current package executes trusted official code in a local process. It is not a sandbox for
untrusted documents or community renderer implementations.

Provider calls forward renderer diagnostics through `context.reportDiagnostic`. The initial record
states the frame count, worker policy/ceiling, capture path, quality, GPU mode and selected encoder.
Phase timings, concurrency changes and per-worker seek/preparation/PNG totals are recorded once
per phase, decision or finished worker. Disposable capture-process
stdout/stderr are streamed as diagnostics and drained before the call returns; existing output limits
still apply. Phase changes cover preparation, decoding, browser startup, capture, encoding and storage.
`hypit logs <build-id>` retains those records after temporary rendering files have been removed.
